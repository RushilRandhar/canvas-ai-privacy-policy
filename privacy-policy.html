  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 10, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>CanvasAI helps users access their Canvas course files, process them with AI models, and display results directly in their browser. It is designed to operate entirely under user control and does not collect or share personal information.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, sell, or share personally identifiable information such as name, email, or location.</li>
    <li>The Extension temporarily accesses Canvas pages and course materials that the user explicitly opens and activates the extension on. This content is processed only to generate the requested AI output and is not stored permanently or shared with third parties.</li>
    <li>Cookies from Canvas are read locally to confirm that the user is already signed in, allowing the extension to fetch files they have permission to access. Cookies are never stored or transmitted externally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Extension uses limited Chrome permissions strictly to provide its core features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>activeTab / tabs / scripting</strong> – To access the current Canvas page when the user clicks the extension and insert scripts needed to gather course materials.</li>
    <li><strong>host permissions</strong> – To interact with Canvas and Google Cloud Storage APIs securely.</li>
    <li><strong>storage</strong> – To save local preferences and cache temporary data.</li>
    <li><strong>cookies</strong> – To confirm user sessions with Canvas.</li>
    <li><strong>downloads</strong> – To allow users to download processed results to their device or cloud storage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Extension may communicate with external APIs (such as Google Cloud Storage or Gemini) to process files and return results. These requests are made securely over HTTPS, and no user-identifying data is transmitted.</p>

  <h2>Remote Code</h2>
  <p>The Extension does not fetch or execute remote code. All scripts run locally within the browser.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>No user data or content is permanently stored by the Extension or its developers. Any temporary data processed by the backend APIs is automatically deleted after completion of the user’s request.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
