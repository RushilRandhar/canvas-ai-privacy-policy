  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 10, 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    CanvasAI (“the Extension”) helps users access course materials from Canvas LMS
    and generate study assistance using AI models. The Extension operates only when
    the user chooses to activate it and processes data solely for the purpose of
    providing the requested functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Access</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension accesses the following data <strong>only when the user activates the
    extension on a Canvas page</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Course files, documents, and text content visible to the user on Canvas</li>
    <li>User’s existing Canvas session cookies (read-only) to confirm that they are logged in</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Extension does <strong>not</strong> collect or store personal identifiers such as name,
    email, password, or contact information.
  </p>

  <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>User content (such as files or text) may be temporarily transmitted to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CanvasAI’s backend server</strong> for processing</li>
    <li><strong>Google Gemini or other AI APIs</strong> to generate summaries or study materials</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This content is used <strong>only</strong> to fulfill the user’s request and is not used for any
    analytics, advertising, or secondary purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No user data is permanently stored by the Extension.</li>
    <li>Any content transmitted to CanvasAI’s backend or AI APIs is processed
      temporarily and automatically deleted after processing is complete.</li>
    <li>No data is sold or shared with third parties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The Extension uses only the permissions required to function:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>host permissions</strong> – to access Canvas pages and the CanvasAI backend</li>
    <li><strong>cookies</strong> – to read the user’s existing Canvas session for authentication</li>
    <li><strong>storage</strong> – to store temporary preferences and local settings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension communicates with secure APIs (such as CanvasAI’s backend server and
    Google Gemini) to process user-initiated requests. These services do not store or
    reuse user content outside the scope of fulfilling the request.
  </p>

  <h2>User Control and Consent</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is processed only when the user actively initiates an action.</li>
    <li>Users may delete local extension data via Chrome’s extension settings.</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the extension immediately stops all data processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Remote Code</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does not fetch or execute any remote code. All executable code is
    packaged within the extension.
  </p>
